This a very simple Vue3 app. From `App.vue`, there is a router view pointing to `components/Game.vue`, where all the logic happens. Data is represented in various json files. To run it locally, clone the repository, make sure that you have everything installed to use Vue and run the following commands in the repository's directory:

```
npm i
npm run dev
